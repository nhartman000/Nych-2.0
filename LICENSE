3. Reciprocity Clause (Copyleft Compatibility)
Any modified version or fork of NYCH that is:
• published,

You may extend, but you cannot close or privatize NYCH-derived systems.
4. No Patent Rights Granted
This license does not grant any patent rights, implied or explicit.
If you create or obtain patents covering enhancements or implementations based on NYCH:
• you must grant a royalty-free, non-exclusive license back to the NYCH Protocol for public non-commercial use
• and may not assert such patents against the NYCH Protocol or its contributors.
This prevents patent encirclement by corporations and protects the core ecosystem.
